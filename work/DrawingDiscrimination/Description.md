In the mid-1930’s, there was a widespread assumption that houses in white neighborhoods were more valuable than those in non-white neighborhoods. The federal government adopted this notion into its national policy, officially valuing white-owned property in segregated white neighborhoods higher than houses in non-white or mixed-race neighborhoods. The federal government also incorporated these discriminatory practices in detailed maps of over 250 American cities it created in the mid to late 1930's. In a process that later became known as redlining, these so-called 'security maps' graded each neighborhood on the perceived risk of real estate investment in that community, with race being one of the main factors determining who was able to get a mortgage and where properties were deemed valuable for decades to come. This racial discrimination in housing continued as legal government policy until it was outlawed by the passing of the Fair Housing Act of 1968. During that time, these practices created massive wealth-building opportunities in housing for white Americans while entrenching discriminatory market structures that continue to influence imbalanced housing opportunities and exacerbate the inordinate racial wealth gap in today’s American society.
